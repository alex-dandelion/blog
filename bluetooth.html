        <p>Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)</p>
    <h1>Class of Device (CoD)</h1>
      <p>The Inquiry Access Code is the first level of filtering when finding Bluetooth devices and services. The main
        purpose of defining multiple IACs is to limit the number of responses that are received when scanning devices
        within range.</p>

    <h1>My way to make it works</h1>
      <p>Tryed to connect with <b>pybluez</b> but it doesn't worsk</p>
      <p>After that I find out that most of python scripts use <a href="http://www.bluez.org/about/">BlueZ API</a>
        to work with bluetooth. Followed the instructions from this web site <a hreff="https://computingforgeeks.com/connect-to-bluetooth-device-from-linux-terminal/">computionforgiks</a>
        All works like a sharm, I can discover and conect devices ( my headphones).
        But I need more - connect through python script and send data. So I found website <a href="https://ukbaz.github.io/en/html/reference/bluetooth_overview/index.html">ukbaz</a>
      </p>
